CALL FOR PAPERS

Today's petascale supercomputers contain over 100,000 processor cores, 
and thread counts on exascale systems are expected to exceed 100 million.
Increasingly complex multicore and accelerator node-architectures fuel 
the trend towards massive concurrency, and new, hierarchical parallel 
programming models will be necessary to take full advantage of future 
machines. With increased node, system, and application complexity, scalable
tools will be critical for diagnosing the root causes of correctness and 
performance problems.

To diagnose problems at the extreme scale, tools themselves are becoming more
complex. Tools will require sophisticated infrastructure to monitor, measure,
analyze, and present the causes of an execution's anomalies.  In many cases,
tools will combine online and offline analysis.  They may use sophisticated
modeling and statistical analysis techniques. To manage this complexity, there
is a need both for abstractions that simplify tool design and for 
infrastructure that is reusable and extensible.


SUBMISSIONS

We solicit papers on all aspects of scalable tool abstractions and
infrastructure, including (but not limited to):

  * Generic, reusable tool-infrastructure components
  * Tool-component interoperability
  * Tool-runtime design, including
    - Scalable data structures and data representation for tool runtimes
    - Scalable tool communication infrastructure
    - Tool and operating system interoperability
  * Scalable online and offline analysis techniques, including 
    - Techniques for managing large amounts of information
    - Low-overhead online parallel data analysis techniques
  * Monitoring, measurement and analysis approaches for novel parallel
    programming models
    - Tool support for multithreading, shared-memory, and hierarchical 
      parallelism, including interaction with language ntime and operating
      systems
    - Measurement and attribution techniques for new programming paradigms
  * Scalable presentation of results


SPECIAL JOURNAL ISSUE

All papers from the workshop will be made available online, and selected
papers will be published in a special journal issue.  Details TBD.
