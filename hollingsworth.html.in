   <h3>Biography</h3> 
   Jeffrey K. Hollingsworth is a Professor and Associate Chair of the 
Computer Science Department at the University of Maryland, College Park. 
He also has an appointment in the University of Maryland Institute for 
Advanced Computer Studies and the Electrical and Computer Engineering 
Department. He received his Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in computer sciences from 
the University of Wisconsin. He received a B.S. in Electrical 
Engineering from the University of California at Berkeley.
Dr. Hollingsworthâ€™s research seeks to develop a unified framework to 
understand the performance of large systems and focuses in several 
areas. First, he developed new approach, called dynamic instrumentation, 
to permit the efficient measurement of large parallel applications. 
Second, he has developed an auto-tuning framework called Active Harmony 
that can be used to tune kernels, libraries, or full applications. 
Third, he is investigating the interactions between different layers of 
software and hardware to understand how they influence performance.   He 
is Editor in Chief of the journal Parallel Computing, and will be the 
general chair of the SC12 conference.
